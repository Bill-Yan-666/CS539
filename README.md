Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network for predicting thermodynamic properties of steam

This project aims to provide a model for predicting the thermodynamic properties of steam in the form of multilayer perceptron neural network. The network is trained using data from NIST, which ensures the quality of training data. The performance is evaluated by comparing the result with ground truth, with results from linear interpolation method, and with results predicted by Peng-Robison equation of state.
